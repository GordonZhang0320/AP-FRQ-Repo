## Question 3 Analysis
### Competition/Competitor

This section contains my analysis of Question 3 (Arrays and ArrayLists):

#### My initial approach during the exam:
#### Part 1
- Create competitorList by using a traditional for loop
- Add and create the competitor object at the same time
#### Part 2
- Create one if statment to check even and odd and return the result in the if statment
- Use a for loop to pair up the competitors
  -only up to the lower middle index (after removing the first object if it is an odd list)
- Pair up the competitors
- Create a random even and odd list and test and test the program
  
#### My revised solution after review:
#### Part 1
- Create competitorList by using a traditional for loop
- Create the competitor object first, then add it later
#### Part 2
- Create an if else statment to check even and odd and return the result outside the statment
- Use a for loop to pair up the competitors
  -only up to the lower middle index (after removing the first object if it is an odd list)
- Pair up the competitors
  - for odd list, we loop include the list length divides by 2
  - for even list, we loop exclude the list length divides by 2
- Create a random even and odd list and test and test the program
  
#### Key concepts tested in this question:
- The usage of a loop, and not getting out of bound errors
- Fluently use the method from different classes 
  
#### What I learned from revisiting this problem:
- This problem needs a lot of paper work to clearly visualize what they are asking and what should be done
