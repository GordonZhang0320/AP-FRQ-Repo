## Question 1 Analysis
### Dog Walker

This section contains my analysis of Question 1 (Methods and Control Structures):

### My initial approach during the exam:
#### Part 1
- Since there is two possible outcomes means we need at least 2 if statment.
  -Create one for the case when company has less dogs than max dog.
  -Create one for the case when company has more dogs than max dog.

#### Part 2
- Since the walker walks multiple hours, we need a loop, which the endHour is included.
  -Create two if statments and a boolean variable to check if the bonus is meet.
  -If the boolean is true then add $3 to the result, else do nothing.

  
### My revised solution after review:
#### Part 1
- Since there is two possible outcomes means we need at least 2 if statment.
  -Create one for the case when company has less dogs than max dog.
  -Create one for the case when company has more dogs than max dog.

#### Part 2
- Create a loop, which starts at the startHour end at the endHour is included.
  -Create one if statment that included both possible condition and add $3 directly to the result.
  
### Key concepts tested in this question:
- Understand the conditions that leads to the different outcome.
- Calling the method from a different class.
- Calling the method inside the class.
  
### What I learned from revisiting this problem:
- Always read the passage over and over again to fully comprehend the concept and rule of the game.
