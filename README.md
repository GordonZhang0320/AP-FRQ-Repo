# AP-FRQs-2025

*Solutions written by Gordon Zhang*

## Introduction
This repository contains my solutions and reflections for the AP Computer Science exam taken on May 7th 2025. While reviewing the released questions, I've documented my approach, insights gained, and areas for future growth.

## Exam Experience
In this section, I reflect on my overall experience taking the AP Computer Science exam:

- My preparation strategy for the exam included:
  - just write the code and test it out
  - go over the JQR in a java compiler
- The most challenging aspects of the exam were:
  - understanding what the problem is requiring you to do
  - read the precondition and include checks for condition not mentioned
- Time management techniques that worked well for me:
  - finish all the short questions first, like less reading but more scarp work question
- Mental strategies I used when encountering difficult questions:
  - check JQR and realize what is available for me to use

## Growth Opportunities
Through this review process, I've identified these areas for continued learning:

- Topic/Concept 1: The usage of recursion, I need more practice regarding not losing my track in the middle of doing the problem.
- Topic/Concept 2: The usage of nested for loop, I need more practice regarding to tracing my work on the paper.
- Programming practice: using more while and enhanced for loop, since I mostly used the traditional for loop.

## Resources
Resources I found helpful during my exam preparation and review:

- https://www.w3schools.com/

## Future Goals
Moving forward, I plan to:
- use java in actual programming project or learning how to incoporate java with other new programming language
- I would like to create some more visualize content for the questions, like question 3, I think it is a good idea to be used in a fighting action game.
- I would like to study more java methods using the website I have, and keep researching relative field of study where I can use java in.
